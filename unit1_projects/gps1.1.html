          <h3>Ruby Rockets are pair programming perfectionists!</h3>
          <p>Broadening our educational experience. Providing opportunities to see how others think and 
          collaborate with others while preparing us for real life. Great way to learn and grow from others through the experience.
          </p>
          <p>At its very core, pair programming can be thought of as a two person team driving cross country. You have the driver and 
             the navigator. One does the work of getting the car across and the other is responisble for taking the right roads.
