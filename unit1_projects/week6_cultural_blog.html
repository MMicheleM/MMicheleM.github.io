			<h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>

			<p>"Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group." (Steele & Aronson, 1995)</p>

			<p>The research that has been done has uncovered a variety of key factors that help us to understand stereotype threat. the following five items are from <a href = "http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org">ReducingStereotypeThreat.org</a>

				<ol>
					<li>The consequences of stereotype threat extend beyond under achievement on academic tasks such as white men in sports, women in negotiation, gay men in providing childcare and women in driving.</li>
					<li>Research has also identified who is most vulnerable to stereotype threat - namely anyone whose situation invokes a stereotype-based expectation of poor performance.</li>
					<li>The situations most likely to evoke stereotype threat are ones which increase the salience of the stereotyped group identity.</li>
					<li>The mechanisms behind stereotype threat are still a bit of a puzzle. However researchers have started to identify items like the reduction of working memory resources which ultimately undermines one's ability to successfully complete complex intellectual tasks. Researches are still working to expand their understanding in this area.</li>
					<li>Finally, the focus of researchers is also on how to reduce the negative effects of stereotype threat.</li>

			<p>There are many identities that each of us hold. For me there are at least 5 that put me at risk for self-sabotage (a.k.a. stereotype threat) in the months ahead.

			<h3>Gender</h3>
			<p>I went to Mills College in spite of the fact that it was a women's college; I stayed because it was one. What I discovered about gender and gender bias in my four years there has helped shape the way I view the world. It is but one of many groups with which I associate and fortunately, when it comes to the playing field of STEM, it seems to have done me a world of good to have come of age in such a female positive environment. When my self doubt (conscious or sub-conscious) sets in on the academic front the one thing I can be assured of is that it's not my gender identification that's at play. 
			</p>

			<h3>Age</h3>
			<p>As it pertains to Dev Bootcamp and my desire to switch my professional area of interest the fact that I am somewhat older than many (most?) of my cohortmates could prove my downfall at some point. However coming off a six year stint at a non-profit organization where the average age of my colleagues rivals that of my fellow DBC boots I suspect this area is also somewhat solid for me. That said I recognize it as something that I'm extremely conscious of in the tech environment and while I hope it is minimized while I'm learning I am fully anticipating needing to address this when it comes time to apply for jobs in a few months time.</p>


			<h3>Other Items</h3>
			<p>There are a variety of other identities, which I choose not to share publicly, that I am aware of which put me at risk of stereotype threat. In general though, as it pertains to DBC and tech, I don't know that these will prove salient. That said I think it's incredibly important to be aware of them as stereotype threat is most definitely not limited to academic settings. It simply has been studied there the most.</p>

			<h3>The Plan</h3>
			<p>I have a pretty high level of self-awareness when it comes to my inner dialog - which may or may not prove useful to me in combating the risk of stereotype threat. I have an awareness now of stereotype threat which, as soon I as I had listened to Dr. Steele's speech, caused one of the larger "ah ha!" moments I've had either professionally or personally.</p>

			<p>Having chosen DBC seems to be a solid first step in the process of addressing the threat. Clearly there is an awareness within the existing community and by extension, hopefully, an approach to teaching that allows for maximum success.</p>
