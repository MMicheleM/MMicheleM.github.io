			<h1>
				One Value - Growth
			</h1>	
				<p>The year in question was one of significant growth for me on all levels - emotionally, socially, culturally, intellectually. It was one of the hardest years of my life and yet one of the most rewarding ones. I'm viewing DBC as a similar experience and I'm excited by the growth I know I'll expereince even though some of it shall be painful - and quite likely will, at times, involve, "All the work while crying."

				How much do I try to live up to each value?

				<p>The last topic I was asked for advice on was someone's job search. (And also handling the situation with their current boss. And what to do about a staffer of theirs.)
