		<h1>Regex</h1>

			<img src="images/cute_overload.jpg" width="640px" height="400px" alt="cute kitten overload" />
			<h5><i>(Evidently there aren't any funny regex cartoons out there... ergo cute overload.)</i></h5>

		<h3>Defined</h3>
			<p>Regex - short for Regular Expression - is a special sequence of characters that allows you to match/find other strings or
				sets of strings. They also allow you to extract the portions that match.</p>
			<p>One of the beautiful things about Regex is that they're ubiquitous - they work across all languages and any capable text editor.</p>
			<p>Within the scope of Dev Bootcamp it's also a wonderful thing that there is a Regexp class.</p>

		
		<h3>Syntax</h3>
			<p>The basic Ruby syntax is <i>/pattern/</i> or <i>%r{pattern}</i> You can also search using the <i>Regexp.new</i> constructor.</p>
			<p>The <i>=~</i> operator is Ruby's basic pattern-matching operator. If a match is found the operation returns the index of the
				first match in the string otherwise it returns nil.</p>

		<h3>Metacharacters and Escapes</h3>
			<p>Metacharacters have a specific meaning when appearing in a pattern. To match them literally many of them must be backslash escaped. 
				Ruby Metacharacters requiring an escape are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>(, )</li>
					<li>[, ]</li>
					<li>{, }</li>
					<li>.</li>
					<li>?</li>
					<li>+</li>
					<li>*</li>		
				</ul>
			<p>Anchors are a type of metacharacter that match the zero-width positions between characters, anchoring the match to a specific position.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>^ matches beginning of the line</li>
					<li>$ matches end of line</li>
					<li>\A matches beginning of string</li>
					<li>\Z matches end of string (if string ends with a new line it matches just before the new line)</li>
					<li>\z matches end of string</li>
					<li>\G matches point where last match finished</li>
					<li>\b matches word boundaries when outside brackets; backspace when inside them</li>
					<li>\B matches non-word boundaries</li>
				</ul>
					I got a bit lost with the following ones and so am listing but not trying to define them.
				<ul>	
					<li>(?=pat) is positive look ahead assertion</li>
					<li>(?!pat) is negative look ahead assertion</li>
					<li>(? =pat) is positive look back (minus the space after the )</li>
					<li>(? !pat)" is negative look back (minus the space after the )</li>				
				</ul>	

		<h3>Repetition</h3>
			<ul>
					<li>* stands for zero or more times</li>
					<li>+ stands for one or more times</li>
					<li>? zero or one times</li>
					<li>{n} stands for exactly <i>n</i> times</li>
					<li>{,m} stands for <i>m</i> or less times</li>
					<li>{n,m} stands for at least <i>n</i> and at most <i>m</i> times</li>
				</ul>

		<h3>Examples</h3>
			<h4> Delete empty lines: /^\s*\n/</h4>
			<p>
				The caret (^) stands for the start of the line - indicating we'd like to start the search from the beginning of the line.
				The \s combination represents whitespace
				The * says that we are looking for 0 or more of the whitespaces
				And the \n is, of course, our special character for a newline.
			</p>
			<p>As it stands the above example will read through whatever text you have it search on from the beginning of each line through
				to the end of the line. Depending on what you tell it to (vis-a-vis replacement) it will either be modified as instructed or
				it will remove all empty lines (if you replace it with nothing)
			</p>

			<h4>Remove spaces from beginning of the line: /^ +/ (or /^\s+/)</h4>
			<p>A variation on the above would be to remove any/all leading white spaces from lines.	You can either use a literal space or the \s to 
				indicate the white space.</p>
			<p>So we know the ^ is start of line (and it's $ if you're looking to match end of line)
			 	The space or \s is our white space
			 	And the + looks for one or more of the previous tokens (in this case a white space)
			 </p>


			 <h3>For future consideration</h3>
			 <p>This is but the tip of the proverbial iceberg. There is SO much more to this regex thing than I can begin to capture in a single blog post. 
			 	What is apparent to me is the HUGE value it adds to a programmer's toolbox and I'm excited to work with it more in the weeks ahead!
