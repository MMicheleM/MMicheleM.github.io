			<h1>
				Week 4 Cultural Blog Post
			</h1>		
			<p>There was a time when a supervisor of mine basically melted down on me - starting to scream about
				basically nothing of any real consequence (he didn't like that I had used the pronoun I and not we, 
				he didn't like my lack of [honestly can't recall what else he thought was the problem.] As he got to
				a "stopping point" I began to engage in a limited, deliberative response way. Things like, "I'm sorry
				that X is a problem - can you help me understand how it is that I do X so I can try and avoid doing it
				in the future?" or "I would never intentionally not be a team player, can you help me understand how
				my use of "I" in this case was not okay?" Basically, very calmly, tried to get him to explain to me 
				what it was he was upset over.</p>

			<img src="images/roller_coaster.jpg" />

			<p>The ultimate source of the conflict was his internal angst over other, unrelated, things. Something he
				was later able to admit to himself and then me. It was a particularly hard experience for me to handle
				as it was done publicly in front of others. In the moment I'm sure that my actions were not ideal as
				they were, while not combative, somewhat antagonistic seeming. However in the long run with this particular person it proved to be exactly the right course of action. He went home and discussed the
				"conversation" with his spouse and realized he'd pulled a complete nutter on me. He was able to admit
				that to me awhile later. In the meantime I was passively vibing him for a few days - not the most mature response and yet the best professional one I could muster. I tried to avoid him as much as I could but when it was unavoidable I was definitely vibing him. If I could go back and change anything it would be the vibing part. It's a minor thing but I'd like to be able to truly have taken the higher road in that situation. (It was clear that he was off his rocker when he melted down - so there was never any question that I had done something wrong.)</p>

			<p>I learned a number of things from that encounter - most importantly how to handle him when he got like
				that for while it was his first time doing it with me it was not his first time (nor was it his last with either me or someone else.) It also allowed me to mentor other direct reports of his for dealing with him if/when they found themselves in that position. If I hadn't already had full clatity on the matter I suspect it might have also shown me the light that I needed to leave.</p>
