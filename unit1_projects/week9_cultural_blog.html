			<h2>Abstract Random Thinker</h2>
			<h5>Also an INTJ</h5>

			<img src = "images/intj_percent.jpg" />

			<p>My learning style of Abstract Random is an interesting assessment - one that doesn't fully resonante. Althought none of the styles are 
				absolutes as most write-ups are quick to point out.  
			</p>

			<h3>Descriptive Summaries</h3>
			<p>An excellent summary of abstract random individual:
				"Dislikes routine procedures and orderliness.
				Is extremely sensitive to his/her own and others’ feelings.
				Is flexible, accepting and responds easily to change.
				Learns well through discussion and sharing of ideas.
				Is imaginative.
				Personalizes information.
				Is usually involved in many projects or interest at one time.
				Is focused on friends and relationships.
				Has a fear of not being liked."
			</p>
			
			<p>Another excellent assessment:
				 "Abstractions are great and it doesn’t matter what sequence.  What I’ve seen is the abstract random learners have the simplest time learning because the sequence doesn’t matter, but can have a hard time sharing what they know.  I’ve also noticed they get bored when information is sequential and detailed.""
			</p>

			<h3>Things That Ring True</h3>
			<p>It's true that I'm someone who is imaginative, sensitive, flexible and has the classic fear of not being liked. This can lead me to be more
				withdrawn and quiet until I feel a sense of bond with a group. That said as I've gotten older I've made a point of forcing myself to speak
				up in classroom and other group settings so while it may be an initial challenge for me I imagine it'll be something I'll quickly have in
				hand.</p>

			<h3>Things That I'll Do To Ensure My Learning Style Is Successful At DBC</h3>
			<p>I'm going to not worry about being flexible - at times I think people have perceived it to be an area for growth and I can say, proven out by my
				professional history, that I have no trouble making decisions. So rather than see that as a limitation I'm going to fully enjoy the fact that I'm
				only in charge of my learning for the next 9 or so weeks.  
			</p>
			<p>I'm also going to embrace the group process even more fully as it's evidently a good mode for me. Perhaps the better way of looking at it is that
				I'll be excited to build upon the pairing we've done and will focus on the fact that part of the way I learn is through hearing from others as well as watching them work.</p>

			<p>The pivotal piece for me I suspect will be the ability to put the need to be liked aside, check my ego and embrace the fact that there are a 	number of other students whose learning is far beyond my current level. Rather than focus on worrying that I'm holding them back I'll focus 	onthe fact that I have my own contributions to make and try to keep both my competitive nature and my fear of not being liked in check as 		much as	I possibly can.</p>
