				Week 3 Cultural Blog Post
			</h1>		
			<p>Hearing Shereef talk about the iterations that DBC has seen has actually made me more excited about my time there. It&#8217s cool to know that we&#8217re doing in prep what once was Phase 1 and I can imagine that what we do in Phase 1 will soon become something future cohorts do before they hit Phase 0. Part of why I&#8217m headed to DBC is because I really want to learn to code and while it&#8217s true you can teach yourself I find it is, for my learning style, much easier to do it with some guidelines and teachers. That said I believe it is fully on me to make it my own experience. Much like with jobs wherever you go there you are - it&#8217s you who are the constant. Figuring out how to do &#8216learning verticals&#8217 with code is what DBC is all about and is what tech is often about - so the onus is on us to figure out how to scale those walls in front of us. </p>

			<p>For me learning verticals has been my approach to my professional life and I find it engaging and rewarding (most of the time.) However as a hiring manager I know that there are a lot of people out there who don&#8217t do verticals, they only do learning curves. There is nothing wrong with that you simply have to change your approach and expectations as a manager. The idea that I&#8217ll be immersed in a program with nothing but people who are excited by verticals is an interesting proposition. I cannot imagine what that would be like as I have encountered far fewer of the vertically inclined than I have of the curve group. Shereef's talk prompted this &#8216aha&#8217 moment and I guess my expectation changed slightly to incorporate the idea of being surrounded by &#8216like learners&#8217.</p>

			<p>As for nervousness - all new environments make me nervous. A large part of that is my introverted and shy nature - which I've learned to cover pretty well over the years. That said this entire venture makes me nervous - in both good and stressful ways. What came up for me was the continuing realization that DBC seems like it may be a truly solid cultural fit for me - something I wasn't expecting. I&#8217m excited to see if that proves out.</p>
