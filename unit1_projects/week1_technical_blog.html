			<h1>
				Google
			</h1>
				<p>Google has such a clean design to it. The UI is restful - something rare these days. While the days of animated .gifs as design elements have long since passed the overall design of many sites is so crowded and/or overwhelming that they are hard to navigate, displeasing to the eye and make one's head hurt. The eye is immediately drawn to the Google logo and the search box beneath it - which is very much hte most important area of the site. I'd describe it as: clean, refreshing, functional, easy-to-use and whimsical (when there are Google doodles) It solves the problem of searching for information on the web and its content is minimal as it's more of an application than a website. In addition to its primary function of search it also allows you to tie your Google experience together with Gmail, Google+, etc. The site's footer contains those all important links - About and Privcay & Terms. (It also has links for Advertising, Business and Settings) It's ridiculously easy to navigate as everything is clearly laid out and labeled well. Google always leaves me with a lot more information than I knew I needed when I started my search and on occasion has resulted in the purchase of items that seemed like a good idea at the time.<p>

			<h1>
				Neecha Thai
			</h1>	
				<p>Neecha Thai is our favorite Thai place in Oakland. It uses a basic WordPress layout for its site. The design is clean, the nav bar breaks out the menu, provides contact info and has the ubiquitous about me/us section. It's visually calm, not too distracting with overuse of colors or images. And thankfully no ads. It's one of the better local restaurant sites I've seen as it really does give you all the information you would need to either dine-in or carry-out.</p>
			
			<h1>
				Etsy
			</h1>	
				<p>Etsy is where wallets go to be emptied. Their homepage is clean in its layout and yet contains a plethora of information. They wisely give you top level navigation of the most popular areas (meta shopping groups if you will) and then go on to provide a variety of "options". Recent Favorites is theoretically items that are trending at the moment - so if you didn't know you needed glow in the dark solar system underwear for $18.00 USD you do now. The	Recent Favorites include the number of items in that Etsy member's shop, their username and location as well as their community rating. Below the Recent Favorites you move into Community Tastemakers - curated lists of Etsy items by other members. You're then given a chance to check your influencers (brands and bloggers you love) to see what Etsy items they're grooving on. Etsy then introduces you to a featured artist/crafter before selling you on why you should shop there (satisfied customers, passionate sellers and secure transactions.) It closes with the option to sign up for their newsletter before taking you to the fine print (footer with copyright "logo", language/currancy/location settings, links to blog, about, contact, press, developers, careers, terms, privacy and copyright details.) It's the kind of site that keeps you focused while still providing you with untold riches (of choices.) The spacing a typography make it very readable - presumably targeted at an audience that includes older buyers as the sizing is easy on the eyes.</p>
