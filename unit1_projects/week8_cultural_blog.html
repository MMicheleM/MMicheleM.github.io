			<h2>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h2>

			<h3>Pairing</h3>
			<p>Working with someone to solve a challenge has been a wonderful thing. First and foremost it's been great knowing that others are
				struggling with things as much as I am. Not that I would wish said struggling on anyone just that's it's nice to know I'm not alone.  
				In addition to a sense of camaraderie it's allowed me to feel like this entire adventure may just be doable for me. There are 
				cohortmates who clearly have a greater depth of experience in some, if not all, areas which has made me feel bad in that I feel like as 
				the weak link I'm slowing their learning. On the other hand I know from past experience that sometimes the best way to cement 
				knowledge is by teaching. Regardless of how far my perceived gap in skills has been every one of my pairs has been gracious, 
				giving, supportive with good humor and grace in how they've handled our time together. While I suspect some of this comes from 
				DBC's strong vetting process (that the people they accept have a strong tendency for empathy prior to being accepted and 
				exposed to empathy in the classroom) it's been a rewarding experience and something that I found surprisingly fun. (I'm a
				die hard introvert and while I've managed to establish ways of interacting with life that allow me to work well with others it's
				not something I approach with the same ease as an extrovert.)</p>

			<p>The opportunity to work with others - through remote pairing - has been a fun way to get to know my cohortmates and to build a
				sense of community even though we're scattered across the country.  What has been rewarding to me has been the feedback from 
				others. It's been awhile since I've actually gotten feedback (I literally wrote my last professional review for my boss to 
				deliver to me) and by people who don't know me. While they undoubtedly have been kind in their feedback - given that it's the 
				prime directive from DBC - they've nevertheless done so in a way that feels genuine and their constructive feedback has been
				easy to receive - likely as a result of the kindness in expressing all of their feedback.  
			</p>	

			<p>What has been the most challenging for me when it comes to pairing is my lack of knowledge. It's frustrating to be the weak link
				especially after having been the heavy hitter professionally for a number of years now.  Having come off a job where I had a team
				of about twenty and where I was the one with the depth of knowledge across five areas it's humbling to once again be a true novice
				with so much to learn. That said I've loved almost every minute of this journey so far. It's my professional mulligan, a chance to
				rectify an early misstep where I opted not to major in computer science. I firmly believe that code is my milieu and even when I'm
				completely frustrated being able to do my victory arms when I get my code to work makes it all worthwhile. 
			</p>


			<h3>Feedback</h3>
			<p>Reading the feedback I'd received was always nervous making at first. I seem to have that pesky human flaw of wanting to be liked
				and respected by my peers. Again, having just come off a job where for six years I managed, mentored and was colleague to a vast
				number of staff (and where I evidently earned the hash tag #LifeWithoutMurphy) it's hard not to want to build a solid 
				reputation among a group of supportive, fun people with which to share this next chapter of my life. And the feedback from the
				GPS facilitators was doubly nervous making as it felt like a "live" performance review. </p>		

			<p>The feedback definitely helped to guide each subsequent pairing session. A consistent positive feedback was around my communication
				style - which I was glad to learn translated well in this new environment. The constructive feedback was mostly centered around
				continuing to develop my knowledge in various areas (similar to the constructive feedback I'd give most of my pairs.) Based on
				the feedback I've received I'm going to continue refining my communication style specifically having firmer opinions about roles
				and/or what I want to tackle first. Although I think I've worked a lot on the former and the latter is has really become more
				defined by the challenges themselves. That said I suspect we've got challenges headed our way in less than two weeks which will
				turn all this on its head and will provide us all with new opportunities to refine our pairing skills.</p>	

			<p>Writing feedback was fun - it was the briefest review I've ever had to give anyone. Having come from an environment where the
				annual review was about a page of narrative from me writing two rather brief paragraphs after each session was a pleasure. THe
				challenge I faced was in finding constructive criticism to share. I have yet to pair with anyone whose style I found
				challenging and thus could provide feedback on. Also we are all pretty much in the same boat when it comes to knowledge so I am
				hard pressed to say anything other than it was great to work with you, keep learning and keep up the great work. Granted I've
				generally been able to do so with more specifics than that but it's essentially what all my feedback has boiled down to. Which
				makes me feel a bit guilty as I'm used to providing much more tailored feedback.</p>
			

			<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
			<p>At the end of the day I think this is an outstanding component to the program. Working with others on coding is a great growth
				opportunity on a number of fronts. Clear communication is a must if the driving/navigating roles are going to work. Patience is
				key if you're partnering with someone whose knowledge is behind yours while humility is required when they're ahead of you. A
				sense of humor is also an important thing as there are times when it's important to laugh at your learning curve so as not to
				let it drive you to tears.</p>
