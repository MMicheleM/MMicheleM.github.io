	<h1>Classes vs. IDs</h1>
	<p>One to one (ID) vs. one to many (class)</p>
	<p>You are (hopefully!) the only one with your ID but there are a bunch of us in this class/cohort. Therefore if you wished to apply your style to yourself you'd select ID however if you wanted to share your fabulous style with all of us you'd want to select class.</p>


	
	<p>They both:
		<ul>
			<li>Define a special case for an element</li>
			<li></li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h2>Syntax</h2>
	<p>In HTML you'll use similar syntax. It'll either be <span class = "showtell">id =</span> or it'll be <span class = "showtell">class =</p>
	<p>In CSS you'll being your ID with a hashtag <span class = "showtell"> #</span> and your class with a fullstop <span class = "showtell">.</span></p>
