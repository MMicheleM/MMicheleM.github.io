		<h1>Got Class...?</h1>

			<p>Driven (or ridden in) a car lately? You probably took for granted all its assorted and sundry parts (the engine, its wheels, the number of seats, gas tank size...) as well as the various things it can do (start, stop, go fast, slow down, fly - well maybe not fly just yet.) You could have easily just gotten back from a bike ride or gotten off a plane from that fabulous trip to the number one spot on your bucket list. All these are type of vehicles we might have used to get from point A to point B. And all of them were built at some point off a blueprint that gave their makers their design specs. In Ruby we could say that classes are the blueprints from which objects are made.</p>

			<p>There are four variables, provided by Ruby, that can impact a Class: Local; Instance; Class; Global. Local variables are defined in a method and are not available outside that method. These type of variables begin with a lowercase letter or _. Instance variables are available across all methods for a particular instance or object - which means that they change from object to object. Naming convention for them is that they begin with an @ and are then followed by the variable name. Class variables are available across different objects and both belongs to and is a characteristic of a class. You'll recognize these by the @@ preceding the variable name. Finally we have Global variables. Because Class variables are not available across classes there are times when, should you need a single variable available across classes, you'll want to define a global variable. Syntax for these is that their name is preceded by a $.</p>

			<p>In carrying on with our vehicle analogy we could create a "Vehicle Class" that contains a combination of characteristics (# of seats, gas tank size, etc.) and functions (start, stop, etc.)  You would then in turn have several Instances of the Class when you filled out the specs for a car vs. a bike vs. a plane. Basically Classes allow you to make some sense out of the chaos that is/can be object oriented programming. Keeping track of object definitions - what/where/when/how to access and modify them would become unwieldly without their use.</p>

			<p>I'm sadly lacking in visuals for this week's technical blog and I promise to do better next week. (I also hope that I can come back and do this entry the justice it deserves.) For now this is my meta rollup of Ruby's classes.</p>
