		<h1>Inheritance vs. Composition</h1>

			<p>"Favor 'object composition' over 'class inheritance'" - Gang of Four, <i>Design Patterns, 1995</i>
			</p>

			<p></p>
			<u>Composition</u>
			<p>Composition, in object oriented languages, involves moving features we want to share into their own class. (Ruby provides an additional method for achieving this - Modules.) While inheritance is a cool way to change behavior it is rife with potential error as subclasses can easily make assumptions about the context in which a method it overrides is being called.
			</p>

			<u>Inheritance</u>
			<p>Inheritance usually brings to mind the loss of someone and that person's bequest(s) to another.  However in the world of programming it is a much more convoluted concept and one that seems to seldom lead to a big payout. If anything it would appear that relying on inheritance would be the programming equivalent of a reverse mortgage. It would allow you an easy answer today but would likely leave you well short in the not-too-distant future.</p>
		
			<u>Black Box vs. White Box</u>
			<p>While it seems like a comic strip from days gone by (MAD magazine anyone?) the idea of black box (where structure is strict but "unknown") vs. white box (where contents are completely visible and structure is loose) is a common one among programmers. It's not a language specific one - rather more of a design principle. Composition is black box reuse at its finest - it allows for flexibility and reuse opportunities for the smaller items that have been given power/behavior via delegation (rather than inheritance.)
