			<h1>
				Google
			</h1>
				<p>Google is seeking to solve the problem of web search as its primary challenge with good user experience across all its products as a secondary issue. Visually I find that there are no challenges - though I'm certain that many peopel would find the spartan homepage unpalatable.</p>

			<h1>
				Neecha Thai
			</h1>	
				<p>Neecha Thai is seeking to entice people to eat their food as their primary challenge. Secondarily they want to make sure people know how to get there, how to get ahold of them. Having the full menu on the site makes it easy for people to place phone orders in an efficient manner. Visually it's very clean and relatively sparse as well. For some (perhaps a lot of) consumers the lack of photos of the various dishes may be a detractor. Otherwise the layout, which uses WordPress, is a very clean and easy to navigate one.</p>

			<h1>
				Etsy
			</h1>	
				<p>Etsy is trying to facilitate the sale of goods by independent sellers. Visually it's a little more noisy than Google or Neecha Thai but is still really clear in its navigation. I would argue there are no visual challenges here as it's a good mix between text and images, good spacing/leading, font is readable, color palatte is serene (and probably market researched so as to be one that promotes purchasing.)</p>

				I evidently have a real issue with what I consider to be "clean" design. 
				<br>
				While it doesn't stop me from using sites I find overwheleming (e.g. Amazon) I do appreciate what I consider to be good design.
