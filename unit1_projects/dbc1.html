    	<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>	The idea that I would be starting a <a href="http://www.mmichelemurphy.net" title = "My "Someday, Maybe..." Blog">blog</a> again has been on my brain but not my priority list for quite some time. There are so many other blogs out there about DBC experiences that I don't feel compelled to focus solely on that but instead hope to turn it into some sort of a showcase of my work. Or I could just go with a really clean GUI and focus on a web app like <a href="http://wwww.google.com" target="_blank">this</a>. If I were going to put my email out there for the world to see I suppose I would say mail me at X [at] gmail.com - rather than go <i>old</i> school and use <a href="mailto:notreallyanaddy@thisisfundontyouthink.net">click here</a> to send me a note. </p>
    
		<h2>Or not...</h2>
		<p> Alternatively we could just go with <img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Double-alaskan-rainbow.jpg" alt="rainbows"> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnzlbyTZsQY" target="_blank"><em>unicorns</em></a>.</p>

		<h3>Things currently on my mind</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>My Inner Critic</li>
				<li>Exhaustion</li>
				<li>Juggling a Full Time Job With Phase 0</li>
			</ul>

		<h4>Things that make me happy</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Chocolate</li>
				<li>Almond Lattes</li>
				<li>Coding</li>
			</ol>
